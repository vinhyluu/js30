    //1) first we grab all the panels
    //make sure it's querySelectorAll and write a function that will toggle on or open

    const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel');

    function toggleOpen(){
      this.classList.toggle('open'); //this is adding the class of .open to .panel. going back up to the css it's flex grow by 5 and font size increases 
    }

    //4) normally you would do something similar to the above; however, there will be multiple transitionend events being fired
    // first we pass in e
    function toggleActive(e){
      //5) when you click on the panel, it'll trigger the transition and when it finishes, it shows you what is being transitioned. the font size AND flex grow so 2 things are tranistioned. in our CSS, when the panel is open we're transitioning both of those when class of open is added .panel.open
      console.log(e.propertyName); //e.propertyName gives you the property name associated with the transition

      //6) really we only care about the flex-grow
      //if it includes the word 'flex' and if that's true, toggle open active

      //SUMMARY: listening for a click on each panel, when smoeone clicks it'll triggler CSS open and then when that finishes, transitionend will fire and thats when we'll toggle openactive 
      if(e.propertyName.includes('flex')){
        this.classList.toggle('open-active');
      }
    }



    //2) on each of the panels we're going to listen for a click
    //we're going to take each of the panels, loop over each one, listen for a click on each one and run the toggle function when it's run
    //why doesn't it toggle open if you make toggleOpen a function like toggleOpen()? that would run on page load. we dont' want to run the function only want it to happen when smoeone clicks it 
    
    panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('click', toggleOpen));
    //3) when the panels expand we also want the top and bottom text to animate in. we're going to use a transitionend to do this. we're also going to toggle class of open active with a function called toggleActive.
    //side note for myself, when you add an eventlistener you have to declare a function similarly to React above it where 'this' refers to the event listener's subject
    panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('transitionend', toggleActive));
